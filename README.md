## Our Upgrade Guide for CodeIgniter

We are a group of students from the University of Trier and created an upgrade guide for the PHP framework CodeIgniter as part of a study project. [This guide](http://docs.codeigniter.jjzjoiczfy-ewx3lzpzk4zq.p.runcloud.link/installation/upgrade_4xx.html) will help you to upgrade a website from CodeIgniter Verison 3 to Version 4, which was released in July 2020.
 
To evaluate our own guides, weÂ´ve built the F1 Season Manager in CodeIgniter 3 and just used the guides to upgrade the website to CodeIgniter 4. This repository shows the F1 Season Manager in CodeIgniter Version 3. You can find the upgraded Version in CodeIgniter 4 [here](https://github.com/FlorianNelles/CI4-Example_F1-Season-Manager).

We hope our guides will help you with your own projects. Also you can make use of the F1 Season Manger, to get a better comprehension for all the adjustments you have to do.
