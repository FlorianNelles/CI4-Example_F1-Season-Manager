## Our Upgrade Guide for CodeIgniter

We are a group of students from the University of Trier and created an upgrade guide for the php framework CodeIgniter as part of a study project. [This guide](http://docs.codeigniter.jjzjoiczfy-ewx3lzpzk4zq.p.runcloud.link/intro/index.html) will help you to upgrade a website from CodeIgniter Verison 3 to Version 4, which was released in July 2020. 
To evaluate our own guides, weÂ´ve built the F1 Season Manager in CodeIgniter 3 and just used the guides to upgrade the website to CodeIgniter 4. You can find the upgraded Version in CodeIgniter 4 [here](https://github.com/FlorianNelles/CI4-Example_F1-Season-Manager).
We hope our guides will help you with your own projects. Also you can make use of the F1 Season Manger, to get a better comprehension for all the adjustments you have to do.
